When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When I'd like to share my work with others, and also keep it stored in the cloud for syncing.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I want changes to transfer when they constitute a logical unit of work. eg. a working new feature, important bug fix, etc. Auto updates may be too frequent, eg every commit, or not take place soon enough.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Clones can refer to making a copy of a repo on my PC itself, or between my PC and GitHub. Forking is a term used to refer to cloning done only on GitHub of another party's repo to my own GitHub account. Branching refers to the creation of a new commit with a label without discarding the previous one, so that each can progress in separate ways (merged later if desired).

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
