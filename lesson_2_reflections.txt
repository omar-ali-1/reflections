What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git folder is created. I need to do it because a regurlar folder which does not have
the .git folder is not a repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediate area between the directory and the repository, which gives us more control over
what gets committed to the repository.
