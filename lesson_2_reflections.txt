What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git folder is created. I need to do it because a regurlar folder which does not have
the .git folder is not a repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediate area between the directory and the repository, which gives us more control over
what gets committed to the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By choosing which files I place in the staging area to be committed, I can be more specific regarding 
which changes I'd like to be included in the commit, giving me more control to make the committed changes
logically seperate.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

When we'd like to make an experimental or radical change to a piece of software. Branching allows us to do that without
affecting the production line of commits.
